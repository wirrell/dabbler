 IPWTH   YEAR DOY = 2020   1
 Value of TAV, average annual soil temperature, is missing.                    
 A default value of 20.0°C is being used for this simulation,                 
 which may produce inaccurate results.                                         

 IPWTH   YEAR DOY = 2020   1
 Value of TAMP, amplitude of soil temperature function, is missing.            
 A default value of  5.0°C is being used for this simulation,                 
 which may produce inaccurate results.

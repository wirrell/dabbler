 Saturated hydraulic conductivity equal to zero for one or more soil layers.   
 Data will be treated as missing.

 The pH of one or more soil layers at initialization                           
 was outside the range pH=1-10, which is unlikely.                             
 It was set by DSSAT to pH=7.
